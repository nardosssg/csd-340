    <h2> Chapter 1: Introduction</h2>
    <p class="intro"> Hello, my name is Nardos Gebremedhin, and I am a junior at Bellevue University. I am currently studying Software Development.</p>
    <p><span class="sentence">My hobbies at the moment are learning new recipes and watching movies </span>. I have also started to walk 3 miles throughout the week.</p>
    <p> This year, I strive to learn more about myself and enjoy the little things. I am noticing that it may be a little harder, but I can do it.</p>
    <p> I have found a couple of hobbies and activities that help with my patience and just take things slowly. Coloring, reading, and going on walks are teaching me to live life and not rush things.</p>
